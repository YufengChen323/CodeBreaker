                By clicking on Start Game below, the computer will generate a four number code. You have to guess the code by entering the numbers (one in each box)
                and clicking on Check Code. It will then print your code, and then two more numbers which indicate the correct numbers in your code. The first number
                is how many numbers you have that are correct, and in the correct position as well. The second number is for the amount of numbers in your code that are 
                correct, but in the wrong place. The computer will print out these numbers not according to how they are placed in your code (It is random order). If you find this too hard, then open Inspector (ctrl + shift + i), go to Console, 
                and type in 'answer' (without quotes). The answer to the code will be printed in the console.
